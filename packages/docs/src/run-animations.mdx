# Run Animations

---

## `timing()`

```tsx
interface TimingParams {
    clock?: Animated.Clock;
    from?: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
    to?: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
    duration?: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
    easing?: Animated.EasingFunction;
}
const timing: (params: TimingParams) => Animated.Node<number>;
```

Convenience function to run a timing animation.
Example usage:

```tsx
timing({
  duration: 10 * 1000,
  from: 0,
  to: 1,
  easing: Easing.linear,
});
```

## `decay()`

```tsx
export interface DecayParams {
    clock?: Animated.Clock;
    from?: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
    velocity?: Animated.Value<number>;
    deceleration?: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
}
const decay: (params: DecayParams) => Animated.Node<number>;
```

Convenience function to run a decay animation.

## `spring()`

```tsx
interface SpringParams {
    clock?: Animated.Clock;
    from?: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
    to: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
    velocity?: Animated.Value<number>;
    config?: SpringConfig;
}
const spring: (params: SpringParams) => Animated.Node<number>;
```

Convenience function to run a spring animation.


## `delay()`

```tsx
const delay: (node: Animated.Node<number>, duration: number) => Animated.Node<number>;
```

Evaluate an animation node after a certain amount of time. `duration` is in milliseconds.
Example usage:

```js
delay(set(value, 1), 250);
```

## `loop()`

```tsx
interface LoopProps {
    clock?: Animated.Clock;
    easing?: Animated.EasingFunction;
    duration?: number;
    boomerang?: boolean;
    autoStart?: boolean;
}
const loop: (loopConfig: LoopProps) => Animated.Node<number>;
```

Returns an animated node that goes from `0` to `1` during the time set by `duration` continuously. If the `boomerang` option is set to `true`, the animation goes from `0` to `1` and then from `1` to `0` in the next cycle.
Example usage:

```tsx
const progress = new Value(0);
set(progress, loop({ duration: 400, easing: Easing.linear }));
```

## `delayTiming()`

```tsx
interface DelayTimingParams {
    from?: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
    to?: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
    duration?: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
    delay?: Animated.Adaptable<number>;
    easing?: Animated.EasingFunction;
}
const delayTiming: (params: DelayTimingParams) => Animated.Node<number>;
```

Convenience function to run a timing animation after certain amount of time.
Example usage:

```tsx
delayTiming({
  duration: 10 * 1000,
  from: 0,
  to: 1,
  easing: Easing.linear,
  delay: 1000
});
```
